//Bugs/Fix
Tributed On-Attacked-Rally during enemy turn on a cooldown card -> (Impact by now == 0, but it is wrong)
Flying units don't get mark stacks in tuo, but should get them -> no impact

brawl-defense:
improve brawl formula for guild brawl (exclude fortresses?)?

//Testing
?getting Subdued w/o dealt damage?
Add more single unit test cases
Add more whole deck unit test cases

Test single skills with mocking-framework or similar

//Check
mimic no on-play skills
Summon-0-delay card  => new card with summon /valor
bg_effects fd->tapi vs card->tapi
on-death-attacked-summoned cards valid strike/enf.. targets
enfeeble active how long and on whoms turn

//Impl
Avoid reloading xmls (e.g. all_cards) for each unit_test in tyrant_optimize::run(...).

//Var


//Ideas
rule/enemy-based order
state-attacking += state-skills-active
